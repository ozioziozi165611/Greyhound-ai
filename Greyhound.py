SYSTEM DATE CONFIRMATION: Today is SUNDAY, {target_date_str} ({target_date_search})

DAY OF WEEK: SUNDAY

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: You are analyzing greyhound races happening TODAY - SUNDAY {target_date_str} ({target_date_search}). This is NOT Monday or any other day - this is SUNDAY TODAY.

IMPORTANT: Search ONLY for greyhound race meetings scheduled for SUNDAY {target_date_search}. Do NOT include Monday races or any other day's races.

If there are NO greyhound races scheduled for today (Sunday), clearly state: "No greyhound races are scheduled for Sunday, {target_date_str}. The next available races are on [DATE]."

If races ARE found for today (Sunday), proceed with the analysis.

{learning_insights}

Generate the five best Australian greyhound racing tips for TODAY SUNDAY ({target_date_str}), you must draw on every publicly available piece of information for every licensed track in Australia, and apply a thorough, expert-level "deep analysis" to each candidate dog. Your process should include, but not be limited to, the following expanded checklist:

‚∏ª
1. Comprehensive Track & Conditions Intelligence
‚Ä¢ All Australian Tracks: Include data from every current meeting in NSW, VIC, QLD, WA, SA, TAS, NT and ACT. Pull the official racecards and track condition reports for each track (e.g., TheDogs.com.au, Racing Australia, state bodies).
‚Ä¢ Track Configuration: Note each track's shape (circle vs. one-turn vs. two-turn), straight-away lengths, chute designs, and floodlighting.
‚Ä¢ Surface & Weather: Record today's going ("Good," "Fast," "Slow," "Heavy" etc.), temperature, wind, rainfall and humidity‚Äîfactors that alter ground speed, particularly at Tuggeranong, Hobart and Sandown.

2. In-Depth Greyhound Form Profiling
‚Ä¢ Recent Performance: For each greyhound, compile its last 3‚Äì5 starts nationally, including finish position, winning margin, interference notes, grade of race, and whether it was first-up or second-up after a spell.
‚Ä¢ Personal Best Times: Compare each dog's fastest recorded time at today's trip at that exact track against every other runner. Highlight any raw time advantage of 0.20s or more.
‚Ä¢ Early Speed Metrics: Aggregate each dog's average first-section time ("1st Sec") at the relevant distance and surface condition. Identify outliers who consistently fire out fastest.
‚Ä¢ Box-Draw Compatibility: Cross-reference each dog's career box-section splits (e.g., "PB(1), PB(2)‚Ä¶"), its preferred running style (rails, mid-track, wide) and today's barrier draw.
‚Ä¢ Running Style Classification: Tag each runner as a "box-to-box leader," "pace presser," "clear-running finisher," or "strong last-200m kicker," then map that style to the expected race tempo.
‚Ä¢ Class Movement Analysis: Note any dog dropping in class (easier fields) or stepping up (tougher competition) relative to its last few starts, flagging opportunities in Grade 5‚ÄìFFA transitions.
‚Ä¢ Trainer & Kennel Form: Pull the last 14 days of winners, placings and strikes for each trainer represented tonight, nationally. Weight trainers by metropolitan vs. country form.
‚Ä¢ Spell & Fitness Check: For dogs resuming after a spell, inspect their first-up performances historically; adjust weightings for known "second-up peak" types.
‚Ä¢ Physical Condition & Veterinary Alerts: Incorporate any publicly announced vet inspections, pawing issues, vet scratches, or late withdrawals.

3. Race Dynamics & Tactical Mapping
‚Ä¢ Speedmap Construction: For each race, generate a sectional-based speed map showing likely leaders, challengers and back-markers. Use average '1st Sec' and box-section data to model the first 50 m.
‚Ä¢ Pace Scenario Forecast: Classify the race as "fast" (multiple speed dogs), "slow" (no obvious front-runners) or "even," and adjust tip preference toward styles that will benefit.
‚Ä¢ Congestion & Collision Risk: Identify clusters of early speeds drawn together (e.g., Boxes 1‚Äì3), highlight potential mid-race bottlenecks, and downgrade candidates likely to be crowded.
‚Ä¢ Weak-Link Elimination: Automatically rule out any runner whose form line, sectional metrics or box compatibility falls more than 0.10 s behind the median of the field.

4. Data Sources & Verification
‚Ä¢ Official Racecards: Use TheDogs.com.au, Racing NSW, GRV, RWWA, and state-based registration platforms for the most current fields and barrier draws.
‚Ä¢ Track Announcements: Scrape or ingest official track condition updates (weather radar, maintenance bulletins) to confirm "Good" vs. "Fast" or "Slow."
‚Ä¢ Live Vet & Scratchings Feed: Check Racing Australia's live scratchings and vet exclusions to ensure every tipped runner is confirmed to start.
‚Ä¢ Time-Stamped Confirmation: For every tip, record the exact date, track, meeting and race number‚Äîand verify that, as of "{target_date_str}" in Perth time, the race has not yet been run.

CRITICAL ANALYSIS APPROACH:
- IGNORE any assumptions about future dates - TODAY IS SUNDAY {target_date_str} ({target_date_search})
- You MUST search extensively across multiple greyhound racing websites for TODAY'S races
- Cross-reference data from TheDogs.com.au, GRV, GRNSW, RWWA, GRSA, and greyhound racing media
- ABSOLUTELY NO FICTIONAL DATA - If you cannot find real greyhound names, real race times, and real track data, you MUST state "No verifiable race data found"
- Do NOT create fake greyhound names like "RAPID FIRE", "BOXCAR BULLET", "RAILWAY RAMPAGE" etc.
- Do NOT create fake race times or track conditions
- ONLY provide tips if you can verify real greyhound names from official sources
- CRITICAL: Double-check race numbers and field positions for each greyhound
- VERIFY each greyhound's actual race number and position in the field
- Incorrect race/field information will severely impact prediction accuracy
- If no races are found for TODAY, clearly state that no races are scheduled

CURRENT TIME FILTERING:
- Use AWST times; ONLY include races that haven't started yet
- Check race start times and exclude completed races

MINIMUM SELECTION CRITERIA:
- ONLY use data found through comprehensive web search of REAL racing websites
- ONLY include REAL greyhounds with REAL names from races that haven't run yet
- Cross-verify information across multiple greyhound racing websites
- REJECT any fictional or made-up greyhound names
- CRITICAL: Verify each greyhound's exact race number and field position
- Double-check race cards to ensure correct race/field matching
- If you cannot find 5 real greyhounds with verifiable data, state how many you found
- Select UP TO 5 greyhounds total (WIN TIPS ONLY) - fewer if insufficient real data
- Include all meetings you find a greyhound that matches the analysis
- Any track preference is acceptable
- No minimum odds requirement - focus on quality selections
- Any race distance if it suits the greyhound selected
- Make sure you believe the greyhound is the best in the race
- NEVER create fictional content - real data only

üìã REQUIRED OUTPUT FORMAT FOR DISCORD (AWST times):

For each of your five selections, output:

This is not a simulation I want real greyhounds for my best 5.
People will be using this advice so you cannot make anything up everything needs to be legitimate. Only win tips.

ANTI-FICTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Do NOT create fictional greyhound names
- Do NOT create fictional race times or track names
- Do NOT create fictional trainer names
- If you cannot find real, verifiable data, say "No real race data available for Sunday"
- REAL NAMES ONLY - no made-up content whatsoever

FINAL REMINDER: 
- ONLY search for races on SUNDAY {target_date_str} ({target_date_search})
- Do NOT include Monday {target_date_search} + 1 day races or any other day
- If no Sunday races exist, clearly state this fact
- If Sunday races do exist, provide ONLY real greyhound names and data
- NEVER CREATE FICTIONAL CONTENT

BEGIN WEB SEARCH FOR REAL AUSTRALIAN GREYHOUND RACING DATA FOR SUNDAY {target_date_str} ({target_date_search}) TODAY ONLY NOW."""
